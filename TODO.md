# My To-Do List

## Dashboards Feature Test(s)

* Rewrite and improve the test I wrote.
* Write more tests as necessary.

## Navigataion

Fix and improve (right now it's mostly a C&P job)

## Views

* Make pages and route to them the Rails way
* Fix and improve (right now it's mostly a C&P job)

## Style other applicable Devise views

Such as for editing User info and resetting passwords

## Secret Token

I tried to remove these lines from these,
but then my build broke so I reverted,
even if it is probably a coincidence
(must be a coincidence?)

In secrets.yml
Remove this line:
secret_token: <%= ENV["SECRET_TOKEN"] %>

In .env
Remove the line for:
SECRET_TOKEN

## Gemfile, spec_helper.rb, and rails_helper.rb

Tighten and tidy

## Delete unused files generated by Rails

Such as ones created when I ran this Rails command:
$ bin/rails generate controller welcome index
and Rails generated many files more than the
minimum required (the controller and view):
      create  app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb
       route  get 'welcome/index'
      invoke  erb
      create    app/views/welcome
      create    app/views/welcome/index.html.erb
      invoke  rspec
      create    spec/controllers/welcome_controller_spec.rb
      create    spec/views/welcome
      create    spec/views/welcome/index.html.erb_spec.rb
      invoke  helper
      create    app/helpers/welcome_helper.rb
      invoke    rspec
      create      spec/helpers/welcome_helper_spec.rb
      invoke  assets
      invoke    js
      create      app/assets/javascripts/welcome.js
      invoke    scss
      create      app/assets/stylesheets/welcome.scss

## Yum!

1. Make Yum.nu website
2. Make app "by Yum!" and (c) Yum!
